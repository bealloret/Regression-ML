# Regression-ML

## Feature Selection File:
This file contains two different algorithms of ML to predict the prices of houses based on their features:
-> DescisionTreeRegressor
-> KNeighborsRegressor
These models are applied in 4 different ways:
1) Without any feature selection (Baseline models);
2) With 2 Feature Selection Methods implemented manually: Variance Threshold and SelectKBest;
3) With 2 Feature Selection Methods implemented using Pipelines;
3) With Feature Selection Methods implemented using Pipelines and Cross Validation Methods.
Note: The dataset contains ordinal, categorical and numerical features that are encoded and/or imputed.
